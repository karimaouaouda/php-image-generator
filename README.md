when i was learning programming I build these project, this project is an image
builder from name, for example if a user open a new account with Jhon Doe the script will generate
a pic contains the first letters J.D with random colors

<hr style="width:40%"/>

to use this in local just assure that you have<b> [PHP](https://www.php.net)</b> already installed
and already added to the environement variables, then you will just install the project
from github using git ( or download it compressed ) execute this command : 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/karimaouaouda/php-image-generator.git --depth=1
```

then enter to the folder : 

```shell
cd php-image-generator
```

after that let's start a local server that point to this project folder

```shell
php -S localhost:8000
```

and done now you can open google chrom or any browser and navigate to <b>localhost:8000</b> (8000 is a port number you can set your own)
or just use the cmd to do that with execute the command (after adding chrome.exe path tp environement variable ) :

```shell
chrome -incognito localhost:8000
```

and that's it :)
